The Random Forest with PCA model also performed very well, with high accuracy (0.99927) and F1 score (0.999271).\n","\n","The **SVM model (SMOTE Subset)** achieved high accuracy (0.99860) and F1 score (0.998600), which are slightly lower than the top-performing Random Forest models. However, it demonstrated a remarkably fast training time of **2.52 seconds**, significantly faster than the Random Forest models on Raw Data (203.42s) and With SMOTE (314.69s). The Random Forest with PCA had a training time of 24.39s, which is faster than the other RF models but still considerably slower than the SVM.\n","\n","The SVM model's confusion matrix was [[1796, 4], [3, 3197]], indicating a small number of misclassifications. Its false positive rate was 0.002222, slightly higher than the Random Forest with PCA model (0.000000) but lower than the Random Forest models on Raw Data and With SMOTE (which had NaN for this metric, likely due to perfect recall making the calculation undefined).\n","\n","### 2. Resource Usage Analysis\n","\n","The resource usage data collected includes timestamps, CPU percentage before and after events, and memory usage before, after, and consumed.\n","\n","\n","Overall Resource Usage Trends:\n","- Average CPU Percent Before: 24.63\n","- Average CPU Percent After: 10.44\n","- Average Memory Before: 5272951661.71 bytes\n","- Average Memory After: 5272464822.86 bytes\n","- Average Memory Consumed: -486838.86 bytes\n","- Maximum Memory Consumed: 92454912.00 bytes\n","\n","\n","A key limitation is that **the resource usage logs could not be directly linked to specific models** or their training/prediction phases. The timestamps in the resource usage data do not align with the training times recorded for each model, and there is no model identifier in the resource usage logs. Therefore, the resource usage analysis provides general trends across all logged events rather than model-specific consumption.\n","\n","The data indicates varying levels of CPU and memory usage during different logged events. Some events show significant memory consumption, while others show negative memory consumption (memory release).\n","\n","### 3. Performance and Resource Usage Trade-offs\n","\n","Analyzing the performance and resource usage together highlights trade-offs:\n","\n","- **Random Forest (Raw Data) and (With SMOTE):** Achieve perfect performance but at the cost of very long training times and potentially high, but unquantified, resource usage during training.\n","- **Random Forest (With PCA):** Represents a better trade-off, maintaining high performance while significantly reducing training time compared to the other RF models. Resource usage is not directly linked but is likely lower during training due to the reduced dimensionality.\n","- **SVM (SMOTE Subset):** Offers a different trade-off – slightly lower performance than the top RF models but exceptionally fast training time. This suggests efficient resource utilization during training, though specific usage is not available.\n","\n","The SVM model stands out for its speed, making it potentially suitable for scenarios where rapid model training or frequent retraining is required, even if it means a marginal reduction in peak performance compared to the slowest models.\n","\n","### 4. Recommendations and Potential Improvements\n","\n","Based on the analysis, the following next steps and potential improvements are recommended:\n","\n","#### For the SVM Model:\n","- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explore tuning SVM hyperparameters (e.g., C, gamma, kernel type) to potentially improve accuracy and F1 score. The goal would be to try and match the performance of the top Random Forest models while maintaining a reasonably fast training time.\n","- **Kernel Exploration:** Experiment with different kernel functions beyond the default (likely RBF) to see if a different decision boundary can improve performance on this specific dataset.\n","- **Resource Profiling:** Although the training time is fast, if resource usage becomes a concern for larger datasets or in deployment, implement specific profiling tools to monitor SVM's CPU and memory usage during training and prediction.\n","- **Evaluate on Different Data Subsets/Preprocessing:** While SMOTE helped balance the dataset, evaluating the SVM's performance and resource usage on other balanced subsets or with alternative preprocessing techniques could be beneficial.\n","\n","#### For Other Models:\n","- **Reduce Training Time (Random Forest - Raw and SMOTE):** Prioritize methods to significantly reduce the training time of the Random Forest models on Raw Data and With SMOTE. This could involve:\n","    - **Feature Selection:** Identifying and using only the most relevant features.\n","    - **Further Dimensionality Reduction:** Exploring techniques like t-SNE or UMAP if PCA is not sufficient or suitable.\n","    - **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Tuning Random Forest specific hyperparameters like `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, etc., to find a balance between performance and speed.\n","    - **Algorithm Variations:** Investigating faster ensemble methods or implementations.\n","- **Optimize Random Forest (With PCA):** Fine-tune the number of PCA components and Random Forest hyperparameters to potentially find an even better balance between the high performance achieved and the reduced training time.\n","- **Consistent Resource Logging:** Implement a more robust system for logging resource usage that explicitly links the logs to the specific model being trained or used for prediction. This would allow for a more detailed analysis of resource consumption per model and help identify bottlenecks.\n","\n","### 5. Conclusion\n","\n","The SVM model demonstrates excellent speed with high performance, making it a strong contender for certain applications. However, there is potential to further improve its performance metrics through tuning.
